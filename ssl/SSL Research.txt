SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) and TLS (Transport Layer Security) are cryptographic protocols that secure communication over the internet; TLS is the modern, more secure successor to SSL. HTTPS, which uses TLS, encrypts data between client and server, preventing eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks, unlike HTTP which transmits data in plaintext. Without SSL/TLS, web applications are vulnerable to data breaches, identity theft, and loss of user trust. Real-world incidents like the Panera Bread and Equifax breaches were exacerbated by missing or misconfigured SSL, exposing millions of users to risk. Misconfigurations such as expired certificates or weak cipher suites can also lead to exploitation, even if SSL is present.
